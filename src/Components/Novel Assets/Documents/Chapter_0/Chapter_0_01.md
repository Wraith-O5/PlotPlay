## Chapter 0: The Beginning


#### *Sigh*

A man in a black robe was sitting by himself in the seamless night under the stars.

‘The world went to shit in just five years.’

All he saw in those five years was annihilation, chaos, and corpses a lot of it in fact. But, some of those corpses refused to die alone.

'What a twisted world it is or is it already twisted in the first place?' He chuckled to himself while reminiscing.

"Young man! What are you doing by yourself?" The old man said. He reminds you of a typical grandpa, but isn't it strange?

Why would there be any old people left when the whole world was on fire?

"Exploration" The man monotonously said without looking at the old man.

"Exploration of your mind? How philosophical!" The old man said while grinning slightly. Then, the two of them fell silent.

Next, came the harmony of the night under the starry sky.
