“It’s beautiful, isn’t it? This world.” The old man said seemingly with his own insight of the world.

The man nodded before blandly said.

"How philosophical."

The old man looked stunned for a moment before laughing out loud.

### _HAHAHAHA_

"You're gonna make this old geezer die of laughter. I didn't know you could make a joke." The old man said while still laughing.

The man finally took a look at the older man who was still laughing his ass off. Then, he turned his head back to look at the night sky.

'How long has it been?' The man thought as a smile slightly formed on his face.

So, how did it get here?

It all began with something that happened five years ago.
