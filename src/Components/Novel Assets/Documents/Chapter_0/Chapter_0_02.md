*Stars by the night sky*,

*Wind blow by the plain*,

*Song bring by the animals*,

*Harmony being born by nature*.

*It is the harmony of the night under the starry sky*,

*It is the unforgettable beauty of the world we live in*.

*It can bring us the strength to live for another day*,

*It can also bring us back the dream we once had*.
